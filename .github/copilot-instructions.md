We use Hardhat to compile and manage Solidity tasks.

Use Ethers v6 in scripts and tasks.

Both Ethers v6 and Viem are used in tests. In most cases, we use
ethers to reduce the code complexity in tests. But we'll use Viem
for it's types and providing example code for frontend.

In solidity files, please assume those files will be verified
and publish some day. So please suggest me proper name and comments
in English. I could write @dev / @notice in Chinese, but just suggest
those words in English.

The first line of Git commit MUST in English. I prefer to add an emoji
in the beginning of the title, to describe the category of this commit
about.
